Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager.
It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share expenses with a group of people.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills.
Balances are not an absolute amount of money at members disposal but rather a relative information 
showing if a member has spent more for the group than the group has spent for her/him, independently of exactly who spent money for whom.
This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes.
Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users.
Projects can be shared with other Nextcloud users or via public links.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

[PayForMe](https://github.com/mayflower/PayForMe) iOS client is currently under developpement!

The private and public APIs are documented using [the Nextcloud OpenAPI extractor](https://github.com/nextcloud/openapi-extractor/).
This documentation can be accessed directly in Nextcloud.
All you need is to install Cospend (>= v1.6.0) and use the
[the OCS API Viewer app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocs_api_viewer) to browse the OpenAPI documentation.
